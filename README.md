## What is Competitive Trick Skiing?
In case you’ve never heard of trick skiing. It’s an event in 3-event water skiing where you are scored on how many tricks you can do in 20 seconds, with more difficult tricks being scored higher. Tricks all have defined point values so you either get all the points or no points when trying a trick, there are no subjective “Style Points” involved. When you do a trick like a Back Flip (BFL) you also have the option to do a Reverse Back Flip (RBFL) if they are consecutively done. So, to get scored for doing the reverse of a trick they have to be “back to back”.
